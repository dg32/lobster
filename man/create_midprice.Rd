Cleans quote data according to Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2009)
 Delete entries with a time stamp outside 9:30 am until 4 pm (IMPLEMENTED)
 Delete entries with bid, ask or transaction price equal to zero. (IMPLEMENTED)
 Quotes:
When multiple quotes have the same time stamp, we replace all these with a single entry
  with the median bid and median ask price.
Delete entries for which the spread is negative. (IMPLEMENTED)
Delete entries for which the spread is more that 50 times the median spread on that day. (IMPLEMENTED)
Delete entries for which the mid-quote deviated by more than 10 mean absolute deviations
 from a rolling centred median (excluding the observation under consideration) of 50
 observations (25 observations before and 25 after). (IMPLEMENTED)
Trades:
If multiple transactions have the same time stamp, use the median price.
This function generates the Ledoit-Wolf covariance estimator and mean vector as inputs to draw from the predictive posterior distribution
