# Lobster - a package to work and analyze high-frequency data 

This package is intended to make working with LOBSTER (www.lobsterdata.com) easier. It containts useful functions to extract files obtained from the lobster server and to read the data in an efficient and easy to understand way using *dplyr*. I intend to constantly update the package with functions I need for my research associated with forecasting covariances and analysing flash-crashs. Everyone is welcome to participate!
